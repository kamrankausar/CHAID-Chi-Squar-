CHAID in R

### R version should more than 3.4.X and R-Studio can be any version or you see this error

“package ‘CHAID’ is not available (for R version 3.1.3)”

### Install the CHAID library in R terminal
	
	install.packages("CHAID", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

### Load the library
	library(CHAID)

# Data Sets(Play)
# Data sets Features – Outlook,Temperature,Humidity,Wind,Play_tennis
# Dependent Variable-  Play_tennis
# Independent variable -  Outlook,Temperature,Humidity,Wind
# Some of the datasets
"Outlook","Temperature","Humidity","Wind","Play_tennis"
1,"Sunny","Hot","High","Weak","No"
2,"Sunny","Hot","High","Strong","No"
3,"Overcast","Hot","High","Weak","Yes"
4,"Rain","Mild","High","Weak","Yes"
5,"Rain","Cool","Normal","Weak","Yes"


### Fit tree to data
#CHAID class works on three arguments
# Creating the object of CHAID class
chaid_object <- chaid(formula=,control=,data=)
	1. Formula
	2. Controling Parameter of spliting of tree
	3. Data set

1. Formula
	formula = Dependent_Variable ~ All_Independent_Variable_You_Need
	Example on above dataset(Play)
	formula = Play_tennis ~ Outlook+Temperature+Humidity+Wind
or(use “.” To select all Ivs or “+” to select individual) 
	formula = Play_tennis ~.
	

2.Controling Parameter of spliting of tree will use in CHAID object 
# synatx of chaid_control (Default values)
control_vector_name  <-  chaid_control(alpha2 = 0.05, alpha3 = -1, alpha4 = 0.05,
              minsplit = 20, minbucket = 7, minprob = 0.01,
              stump = FALSE, maxheight = -1)
Arguments of chaid_control()
Note:  -1 represent max
1. alpha2 = Level of significance used for merging of predictor categories
2. alpha3 = level of significance used for the the splitting of former merged categories of                                    	     the predictor.
3. alpha4 = Level of significance used for splitting of a node in the most significant 		     predictor. 
4. minsplit = Number of observations in splitted response at which no further split is 	  		desired.
5. minbucket = Minimum number of observations in terminal nodes.
6. minprob = Mininimum frequency of observations in terminal nodes.
7. stump = only root node splits are performed.
8. maxheight = Maximum height for the tree.
Example 
	vector_name <- chaid_control(minsplit = 200, minprob = 0.1)

3. Data set
data = name_of_DataFrame






All at one place

control_vector_name <-  chaid_control(minsplit = 200, minprob = 0.1)
dt.chaid  <- chaid(formula = Play_tennis ~., control = control_vector_name, data = dataFrame_Name)

# Summary of Tree
summary(dt.chaid)

# Plot the tree
plot(dt.chaid)

# Show the text in plot
text(dt.chaid)
